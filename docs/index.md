## About Me
I engineer solutions by thinking from the user's perspective. Naturally this makes me more of a frontend focused developer for your traditional features and for features tailored for other developers, a dedication to clean code and  documentation. On the frontend, I enjoy working on highly interactive and responsive features. I like building features that save people time and reduce their workload.
